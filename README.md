# Belgian Startup Manifesto
Leading by example: let's open source the Belgian Startup Manifesto like it should. Fork it, make pull requests.

Inspired by [Karen and Xavier's RfP](https://medium.com/@StartupsBe/belgian-startup-manifesto-bde96d5bb7bb)

This manifesto is written in the Markdown language ([introduction](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)).
